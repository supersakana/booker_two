## About

Booker Two was created based on The Odin Project's criteria for building a [Flight Booker](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker). This project gave me the oppertunity to build more complex forms. I also got to practice using mailers with rails and set up a simple system tests. Try out the live preview!
